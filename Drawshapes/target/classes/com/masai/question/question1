Q1. What is Tight coupling and loose coupling?

Answer:--

Tight coupling means classes and objects are dependent on one another. In general, tight coupling is usually not good because
it reduces the flexibility and re-usability of the code while Loose coupling means reducing the dependencies of a class that 
uses the different class directly.

Loose coupling is a design goal to reduce the inter-dependencies between components of a system with the goal of reducing the risk 
that changes in one component will require changes in any other component.Or we can say that Loose coupling is a much more generic 
concept intended to increase the flexibility of the system, make it more maintainable and makes the entire framework more stable.
